# WEB SCRAPING PROJECT ON WORLD POPULATION


## Title:
World Population Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Date:
October 2024

## Description:
This project involved scraping real-time population data from multiple sources, analyzing key metrics such as population growth, fertility rate, median age, and urban population density. The collected data was visualized through heatmaps and scatter plots using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends and correlations. I also applied data cleaning techniques to handle inconsistent formats (e.g., removing commas and converting strings to integers) and presented key insights about the relationships between different demographic factors.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and requests, data manipulation with Pandas, and data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
  
- **Data**: World population datasets, fertility rates, urban density, median age

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to connecting with you!
